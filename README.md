<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A collaborative and interactive wind farm simulator. This project was done during the summer semester 2023 at ifgi.

This project is based on the existing [future mobility project from Imaginary ](<[url](https://github.com/IMAGINARY/future-mobility)>) and adapted it towards the aim of this project.
It consists of multiple components, which will be explained in the following.

        <p align=justify><a>The website allows users to arrange a 16x16 grid with certain areas. These areas include green spaces as water areas and parks, infrastructure as roads and residentials and windturbines of two different sizes.

Together with all these options, the user has the goal, to build the best possible layout to fulfill all goals and leave averyone involved satisfied.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started ‚úá„Éü

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* http-server
  ```sh
  npm install --global http-server
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Lorano and Laxeros07/windpark-simulator.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages in **both** the root directory and the
`server` directory.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. You can use the following commands in the root directory to build the client apps. The
server does not require compilation.
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   npm run watch
   ```

### Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èíà±
1. Start the server by running 
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
   in the `server` directory.

2. Start the frontend by running
   ```sh
   http-server -c-1
   ```
   in the root directory.

The clients, in the root directory, are:

- `city.html`: Presents the city map, to be projected over the exhibition table.
- `dashboard.html`: Shows the auxiliary touchscreen dashboard that displays variables and goals,
  and allows selecting Power-Ups.
- `editor.html`: An editor that pushes changes to the server. Note that it doesn't read updates from
  the server, so it's not possible to use multiple editors simulatenously. It's only meant for
  use during development.

- `index.html`: This is a standalone browser version of the software.

### Configuration

The main configuration file is `config.yml`. The server has to be reloaded after any changes.
Clients get the configuration from the server through the http API and have to be reloaded after
the server to take any changes.

The .env file has other configuration keys that affect the environment.
